# UW boot-camp Week 1 Challange

## Description
This project is an On the job ticket type task. I was given the task to reorganize the code and add in missing elements to make this website meet more Mordern accessibility standards. To do this I first removed unessary parts and condenced the code as much as I thought was reasonable. I then corrected the structure of the HTML code, before touching up on the the missing elements such as miss ing alt text for images and a missing title. I also fixed a bug I found with smaller screens of the quick find links at the top right movin out of position. I learned about HTML ordering and how to better make a website more accessibile.

## Instaliation
No Instaliation is required. 

## Usage
This website is mostly a information stoge site, It does have one feature though. It has quick find links. The Links are located in the to right of the page as seen in the immage below.
